# Regarding Unauthorized Use of Script and DMCA Takedown

## Ownership and Copyright

The script in question is the intellectual property of SubnauticaLaser. We hold full copyright over it. While the script was hosted on GitHub and accessed via a `loadstring`, it was **not** freely licensed for use without permission. Unauthorized use of the script in a video or any content without our consent is a violation of copyright law.

## Reason for DMCA Takedown

The DMCA takedown request was issued because the video in question used our script without prior permission or credit. We are fully within our rights as the copyright holders to remove any content that misuses our work.

## License Clarification

Even though the script was publicly available via GitHub, the absence of a formal license **does not** mean the script was available for free use. Copyright law automatically protects the script from unauthorized usage. We are not obligated to allow any person to use or distribute our script without proper authorization, regardless of whether a formal license was in place at the time.

## Demand for Payment

Any demand for money to have the video removed is **unjustifiable** and constitutes extortion. We do not owe any individual or entity for removing content that misuses our intellectual property. We strongly advise against any further attempts to demand payment for this matter.

## Moving Forward

We request that all parties respect our intellectual property rights. Any future use of our script should be properly licensed and credited. Any further misuse may result in additional legal actions.
